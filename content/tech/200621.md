We cannot have a society in which, if two people wish to communicate, the only way that can happen is if it's financed by a third person who wishes to manipulate them.

Back in the 1980s, actually, I gave my first talk at TED, and I brought some of the very, very first public demonstrations of virtual reality ever to the TED stage. And at that time, we knew that we were facing a knife-edge future where the technology we needed, the technology we loved, could also be our undoing. We knew that if we thought of our technology as a means to ever more power, if it was just a power trip, we'd eventually destroy ourselves. That's what happens when you're on a power trip and nothing else.

回到 1980 年代， 那是我首次在 TED 演讲， 也是我首次在 TED 现场公开演示了 虚拟现实。 在那时，我们知道 我们正面对着一个险恶的未来， 我们所需的技术， 我们热爱的技术 可能会毁灭我们。 我们知道如果我们把技术 当作一种获取更多力量的手段， 如果我们只把技术当作追逐力量的武器， 我们将不可避免地毁掉自己。 当我们追逐权力 而不是其他东西时，这无疑将会发生。

So the idealism of digital culture back then was all about starting with that recognition of the possible darkness and trying to imagine a way to transcend it with beauty and creativity.

所以那个时候 的数字文化主义 往往是首先承认潜在的负面影响， 再想办法用美好和创意 去超越它。

I always used to end my early TED Talks with a rather horrifying line, which is, "We have a challenge. We have to create a culture around technology that is so beautiful, so meaningful, so deep, so endlessly creative, so filled with infinite potential that it draws us away from committing mass suicide." So we talked about extinction as being one and the same as the need to create an alluring, infinitely creative future. And I still believe that that alternative of creativity as an alternative to death is very real and true, maybe the most true thing there is.

我过去总爱用令人毛骨悚然 的语气结束 TED 演讲， “我们正面临一场挑战。 我们得围绕科技去构建一种 美丽，充满意义的文化， 如此深刻，富有创造力， 拥有无限潜力的文化， 去把我们从实施大规模 的自杀中解救出来。” 我们谈的灭绝与创造一种充满诱惑， 无限创意的未来是同一个事情。 我仍然相信将创造力作为 死亡的另一个选项 是非常真实和确凿的事情， 可能世间存在的最真实的事情。

In the case of virtual reality -- well, the way I used to talk about it is that it would be something like what happened when people discovered language. With language came new adventures, new depth, new meaning, new ways to connect, new ways to coordinate, new ways to imagine, new ways to raise children, and I imagined, with virtual reality, we'd have this new thing that would be like a conversation but also like waking-state intentional dreaming. We called it post-symbolic communication, because it would be like just directly making the thing you experienced instead of indirectly making symbols to refer to things.

在虚拟现实的例子中， 我过去谈到它的看法是， 它就如 人类发现语言一样， 语言带来了新的冒险， 新的深度，新的意义， 新的连接方式，新的协调方式， 新的想象方式，新的抚养孩子的方式， 我想象中的虚拟现实，这种新的东西 就像一场对话， 亦如半睡半醒的有意识的梦境。 我们称之为“后符号交流”， 因为这就像可以直接做 你所经历的事情一样， 而无需间接创造符号去指代事物。

It was a beautiful vision, and it's one I still believe in, and yet, haunting that beautiful vision was the dark side of how it could also turn out.

它是个美丽的图景，我至今仍然认为 萦绕在美丽图景的背后 是它可能导致的黑暗一面。

And I suppose I could mention from one of the very earliest computer scientists, whose name was Norbert Wiener, and he wrote a book back in the '50s, from before I was even born, called "The Human Use of Human Beings." And in the book, he described the potential to create a computer system that would be gathering data from people and providing feedback to those people in real time in order to put them kind of partially, statistically, in a Skinner box, in a behaviorist system, and he has this amazing line where he says, one could imagine, as a thought experiment -- and I'm paraphrasing, this isn't a quote -- one could imagine a global computer system where everybody has devices on them all the time, and the devices are giving them feedback based on what they did, and the whole population is subject to a degree of behavior modification. And such a society would be insane, could not survive, could not face its problems.

我想我可以提一下 一位非常早期的计算机科学家， 诺伯特·维纳。 他在我出生之前 的 50 年代写过一本书， 书名叫《人有人的用处》。 在书中，他描绘了 创造电脑系统来收集人类数据 并实时向人提供反馈， 从而可以把他们放在 如同统计学里的斯金纳箱， 一个行为系统中， 他写下了这样的神来一笔， 我们可以想象，作为一个思维实验—— 这不是原话，我只是复述一下—— 我们可以想象一个全球的电脑系统， 人人时刻带着这个设备， 这个设备根据用户 的操作实时给以回馈， 全部人的 行为都会得到一定程度的修正。 这样社会将是疯狂的， 无法生存，无法面对它的问题。

And then he says, but this is only a thought experiment, and such a future is technologically infeasible.

随后他说，但这只是一个思想实验， 这样的未来在技术上是不可行的。

And yet, of course, it's what we have created, and it's what we must undo if we are to survive. So --

显然，我们已经构建了一个 如果我们要生存， 就必须撤销的社会。 那么……

I believe that we made a very particular mistake, and it happened early on, and by understanding the mistake we made, we can undo it. It happened in the '90s, and going into the turn of the century, and here's what happened. Early digital culture, and indeed, digital culture to this day, had a sense of, I would say, lefty, socialist mission about it, that unlike other things that have been done, like the invention of books, everything on the internet must be purely public, must be available for free, because if even one person cannot afford it, then that would create this terrible inequity. Now of course, there's other ways to deal with that. If books cost money, you can have public libraries. And so forth. But we were thinking, no, no, no, this is an exception. This must be pure public commons, that's what we want.

我认为我们在很早以前 犯下了一个非常特别的错误， 要弥补这个错误， 我们就得先理解这个错误。 这始于 90 年代， 然后进入世纪之交， 事情是这样发生的。 早期的数字文化， 事实上，直至今天的数字文化， 都有一种，像左派，社会主义的使命。 跟其他事物不同的是， 比如书籍的发明， 互联网的一切都是公开的， 必须可以免费获取， 因为一旦有一个人无法获得这种服务， 就会制造可怕的不平等。 当然，也有其他的处理方法。 如果书籍需要花钱， 你可以去公共图书馆。 诸如此类。 但我们在想的是，不不不， 这完全是特例。 这必须是纯粹的公共公有物。

And so that spirit lives on. You can experience it in designs like the Wikipedia, for instance, many others. But at the same time, we also believed, with equal fervor, in this other thing that was completely incompatible, which is we loved our tech entrepreneurs. We loved Steve Jobs; we loved this Nietzschean myth of the techie who could dent the universe. Right? And that mythical power still has a hold on us, as well. So you have these two different passions, for making everything free and for the almost supernatural power of the tech entrepreneur. How do you celebrate entrepreneurship when everything's free?

所以这种精神永流传， 你可以在像维基百科这样 的设计中体验到， 以及许多其他东西。 但同时， 我们也怀着同样的热情， 相信另一件完全不相容的事情， 那就是追捧我们的科技企业家。

Well, there was only one solution back then, which was the advertising model. And so therefore, Google was born free, with ads, Facebook was born free, with ads. Now in the beginning, it was cute, like with the very earliest Google.

我们喜欢乔布斯，我们喜欢尼采的神话， 即技术专家可以影响宇宙。 对吧？ 这种神秘的力量仍然对我们有影响。 所以你有两种不同的激情， 支持一切免费， 并且崇拜科技企业家 近乎超自然的力量。 当一切都是免费的时候， 你如何庆祝企业家精神？

那时候只有一个解决方案， 那就是广告模式。 所以 Google 是免费的，但自带广告。 Facebook 也是免费的，也自带广告。 一开始，它挺可爱的， 就像非常早期的 Google。

The ads really were kind of ads. They would be, like, your local dentist or something. But there's thing called Moore's law that makes the computers more and more efficient and cheaper. Their algorithms get better. We actually have universities where people study them, and they get better and better. And the customers and other entities who use these systems just got more and more experienced and got cleverer and cleverer. And what started out as advertising really can't be called advertising anymore. It turned into behavior modification, just as Norbert Wiener had worried it might.

And so I can't call these things social networks anymore. I call them behavior modification empires.

广告确实就是广告， 比如当地的牙医之类的。 但还有个叫摩尔定理的东西， 可以让计算机越来越强大和便宜。 他们的算法越来越好。 大学里面，很多人在研究算法， 它们变得越来越好， 使用这些系统的客户和其他公司 也变得越来越有经验，越来越聪明。 这一开始是广告的东西 真的不能再称之为广告了。 它变成了行为修正器， 就如诺伯特·维纳所担忧的。

所以我不能再称这些为社交网络， 我叫它们为行为修正帝国。

And I refuse to vilify the individuals. I have dear friends at these companies, sold a company to Google, even though I think it's one of these empires. I don't think this is a matter of bad people who've done a bad thing. I think this is a matter of a globally tragic, astoundingly ridiculous mistake, rather than a wave of evil.

Let me give you just another layer of detail into how this particular mistake functions. So with behaviorism, you give the creature, whether it's a rat or a dog or a person, little treats and sometimes little punishments as feedback to what they do. So if you have an animal in a cage, it might be candy and electric shocks. But if you have a smartphone, it's not those things, it's symbolic punishment and reward. Pavlov, one of the early behaviorists, demonstrated the famous principle. You could train a dog to salivate just with the bell, just with the symbol. So on social networks, social punishment and social reward function as the punishment and reward. And we all know the feeling of these things. You get this little thrill -- "Somebody liked my stuff and it's being repeated." Or the punishment: "Oh my God, they don't like me, maybe somebody else is more popular, oh my God." So you have those two very common feelings, and they're doled out in such a way that you get caught in this loop. As has been publicly acknowledged by many of the founders of the system, everybody knew this is what was going on.

我不想诋毁那些优秀的个人， 我在这些公司有好朋友， 把公司卖给了谷歌，尽管 我认为它是这些帝国中的一个。 我不认为这是坏人做坏事的问题， 我觉得这只是一个全球性的悲剧， 可笑的错误， 而非一波邪恶的浪潮。

But here's the thing: traditionally, in the academic study of the methods of behaviorism, there have been comparisons of positive and negative stimuli. In this setting, a commercial setting, there's a new kind of difference that has kind of evaded the academic world for a while, and that difference is that whether positive stimuli are more effective than negative ones in different circumstances, the negative ones are cheaper. They're the bargain stimuli. So what I mean by that is it's much easier to lose trust than to build trust. It takes a long time to build love. It takes a short time to ruin love.

我再给你们讲一讲 关于这个特别的错误 是如何作用的。 用行为主义的理论讲， 你给生物——不管这个生物 是老鼠，狗还是人—— 一个小的奖赏，或者一个小的惩罚， 作为他们动作的反馈。 如果你在笼里养了一只动物， 这个奖惩可能是糖果或电击。 但如果你拥有一台智能手机， 奖惩就不是这些实物，而是象征性的。 巴甫洛夫，一位早期的行为学家， 阐述了这条知名的原则。 用铃声，用一种符号 就足以让一只狗流口水。 所以在社交网络上面， 社交奖惩的作用就如同 现实中的奖惩一般。 我们都知道这些东西 带给我们的感觉， 你会有点小兴奋—— “有人喜欢我的东西，它又被重复了。” 或者是惩罚：“天呀！他们不喜欢我， 也许其他人更受欢迎，老天！” 所以你有这两种非常普遍的感受， 它们以这样的方式 让你困在这个循环中。 类似系统的许多创始人已经公开承认 每个人都知道这是怎么回事。

Now the customers of these behavior modification empires are on a very fast loop. They're almost like high-frequency traders. They're getting feedbacks from their spends or whatever their activities are if they're not spending, and they see what's working, and then they do more of that. And so they're getting the quick feedback, which means they're responding more to the negative emotions, because those are the ones that rise faster, right? And so therefore, even well-intentioned players who think all they're doing is advertising toothpaste end up advancing the cause of the negative people, the negative emotions, the cranks, the paranoids, the cynics, the nihilists. Those are the ones who get amplified by the system. And you can't pay one of these companies to make the world suddenly nice and improve democracy nearly as easily as you can pay to ruin those things. And so this is the dilemma we've gotten ourselves into.

但问题是， 传统上，在行为主义方法 的学术研究中 有积极和消极刺激的对比。 在这个商业设定中， 则出现了新的差异， 这种差异远离学术世界 已经有一阵子了， 这个差异在于，在不同的环境中， 无论积极刺激是否 比消极刺激更加有效， 消极刺激往往成本都更加低廉。 这是讨价还价的刺激。 所以我的意思是，失去信任 总比构建信任要更加容易。 需要很长的时间才能构建爱情， 但却只需要短短的时间 就足以毁掉爱情。

The alternative is to turn back the clock, with great difficulty, and remake that decision. Remaking it would mean two things. It would mean first that many people, those who could afford to, would actually pay for these things. You'd pay for search, you'd pay for social networking. How would you pay? Maybe with a subscription fee, maybe with micro-payments as you use them. There's a lot of options. If some of you are recoiling, and you're thinking, "Oh my God, I would never pay for these things. How could you ever get anyone to pay?" I want to remind you of something that just happened. Around this same time that companies like Google and Facebook were formulating their free idea, a lot of cyber culture also believed that in the future, televisions and movies would be created in the same way, kind of like the Wikipedia. But then, companies like Netflix, Amazon, HBO, said, "Actually, you know, subscribe. We'll give you give you great TV." And it worked! We now are in this period called "peak TV," right? So sometimes when you pay for stuff, things get better. We can imagine a hypothetical --

这些行为修正帝国的客户 处于非常快速的循环中， 他们就像高频交易员 不断从用户的消费中获得反馈， 不是消费就是其他别的活动， 他们一旦发现凑效的方式， 就去做更多这样的事情。 他们可以得到快速反馈， 这就意味着他们会对 更多的负面情绪做出反应， 因为负面情绪来得更加快速。 因此，即便是善意的商家， 认为他们做的只是牙膏广告， 也最终诱发了消极人群的增加， 那些负面情绪，比如恶作剧， 偏执， 愤世嫉俗，虚无主义， 都是容易被系统放大的负面情绪。 而且你还无法通过给这些公司付钱 让他们突然把世界变好， 提升民主， 无法跟你付钱毁掉这些东西那样容易。 所以这就是我们所陷入的困境。

替代方案是拨转时钟， 克服极大的困难， 重做决定。 重做决定意味着两件事情。 这首先意味着很多人， 那些可以承担得起的， 可能最终要为这些东西买单。 你为搜索买单，你为社交网络买单。 你如何买单？也许是通过 订阅付费的方式， 也许是微支付， 有很多选择。 假如你们有些人心存抗拒，想的是， “老天，我才不会为这些东西买单！ 你怎么能做到让别人付钱呢？” 我想要提醒大家刚刚发生的事情。 在 Google 和 Facebook 形成免费观念的同时， 很多网络文化也相信在未来， 电视和电影也会以类似维基百科 那样的方式创作。 但同时，诸如 Netflix， Amazon，HBO 那样的公司则说 “订阅吧，我们会给你 精彩的电视节目！” 这还挺有效的！ 我们现在所处的时代叫 “顶峰电视”时代，对吧？ 所以有时候，当你为此付费了， 事情就变得更好了。 我们可以想象一种假设——

We can imagine a hypothetical world of "peak social media." What would that be like? It would mean when you get on, you can get really useful, authoritative medical advice instead of cranks. It could mean when you want to get factual information, there's not a bunch of weird, paranoid conspiracy theories. We can imagine this wonderful other possibility. Ah. I dream of it. I believe it's possible. I'm certain it's possible. And I'm certain that the companies, the Googles and the Facebooks, would actually do better in this world. I don't believe we need to punish Silicon Valley. We just need to remake the decision.

Of the big tech companies, it's really only two that depend on behavior modification and spying as their business plan. It's Google and Facebook.

我们可以想象一个 假设的“顶峰社交媒体”世界。 它会是什么样子？ 这意味着当你登陆后， 你可以得到真正有用的 权威医疗建议，而非社交狂躁 这可能意味着，当你想要真实信息时， 就不会有一堆奇怪的， 偏执的阴谋论冒出来。 我们可以想象其他美妙的可能。 啊！ 这是我的梦想，我相信这是可能的。 我确信这是可能的。 我确定 Google 和 Facebook 这类公司 在这个世界上可以做得更好。 我不认为我们需要惩罚硅谷。 我们只需要重新做决定。

在大型科技公司中。 确实只有两家公司 以行为修正和信息监视 作为商业计划。 他们就是 Google 和 Facebook。

And I love you guys. Really, I do. Like, the people are fantastic. I want to point out, if I may, if you look at Google, they can propagate cost centers endlessly with all of these companies, but they cannot propagate profit centers. They cannot diversify, because they're hooked. They're hooked on this model, just like their own users. They're in the same trap as their users, and you can't run a big corporation that way. So this is ultimately totally in the benefit of the shareholders and other stakeholders of these companies. It's a win-win solution. It'll just take some time to figure it out. A lot of details to work out, totally doable.

我爱各位。 这是实话，他们都很棒。 请允许我这么说， 如果你观察一下 Google， 他们可以无止境地向 这些公司分摊成本中心， 但他们无法分摊利润中心。 他们无法多元化，因为他们醉心于此。 他们沉迷于这种模式， 跟他们的用户一样， 他们跟用户处在同样的陷阱。 你不能以那种方式运营一家大公司。 所以这最终完全是为了股东 以及公司其他利益相关者的利益。 这是双赢的方案， 只是需要花点时间想出解决方法。 很多细节问题需要解决， 这是完全可行的。

I don't believe our species can survive unless we fix this. We cannot have a society in which, if two people wish to communicate, the only way that can happen is if it's financed by a third person who wishes to manipulate them.

我不相信我们的物种可以生存下去， 除非我们修正这点。 我们不应该活在这样一个社会， 如果两个人想要沟通， 唯一方式就是需要被想操纵他们 的第三个人赞助。

In the meantime, if the companies won't change, delete your accounts, OK?

与此同时，如果公司不改变， 就注销你的账号，好吗？

That's enough for now. Thank you so much.

我要说的就这些。 谢谢诸位。
